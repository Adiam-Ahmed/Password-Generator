// Array of special characters to be included in password
var specialCharacters = [];
// Array of numeric characters to be included in password
var numericCharacters = [];
// Array of lowercase characters to be included in password
var lowerCasedCharacters = [];
// Array of uppercase characters to be included in password
var upperCasedCharacters = [];



var passwordLength;
var charset = "";


Step one : We have a function to prompt user for password options 
//1st we let the user insert the length of the password save to var passwordLength
// make sure to loop the user if they didnt insert length b/w 8 up to 128
// valadiate for each input of character (lowercase uppercase numeric n special character)the user wants by using conform()
// we created a set of character to save the characted that user wants to include , 
//if yes they will be join into the empty string called charset , if not then no


Step two: We create a Function for getting a random element from the chareset
//we pass in charset to the function as param 
//We created a var that will select a random number which we can use as an index 
//this function will return a random character from the charset 


Step three:  Function to generate password with user input
//1st we create an empty string to hold the generated password
//2nd we enter a loop until we get the password length requested by the users 
//this loop will call the getrandom function and the character that will be selected will get concated into the empty string password
// we created a var called passwordtext to target an HTML element with the ID "password" using the querySelector() method provided by DOM
//then we target the passwordtext value to be the value of the variable password.

// Get references to the #generate element by targeting the DOM
var generateBtn = document.querySelector('#generate');

// Write password to the #password input
function writePassword() {
  getPasswordOptions(); // Retrieve password options before generating

}

we Add event listener to generate button
generateBtn.addEventListener('click', writePassword);
